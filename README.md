# Face-Recognition

Using Pythons opencv , numpy , face_recognition libraries , I have developed this Face recognition ML model . 
An additional feature here is that , if an unknown face is detcted , it will prompt you to enter name for the unknown face and then save it in the path of the data.


To run in terminal or cmd -

>> python face_recog.py
